# Introduction
This project is a tool that was designed to facilitate the process of language learning, specifically in the area of vocabulary acquisition. The goal is to build vocabulary lists from translated words and full sentences retrieved from online services such as Deepl and Google Translate, as well as Reverso results.

## Usage
To run the Reverso client
```
python reverso_window.py
``` 
To run the translator client
```
python translate_window.py
```

## Work in Progress
Please note that this project is still a work in progress. The following features have yet to be implemented:

- The window should be arranged with the translator client on the left, the Reverso client in the middle, and the list on the right side.
- The ability to save, load and print lists in an external document.
- Ability to delete items from the list.

## Dependencies
This tool depends on the following external packages:
- deepl
- googletrans
- PyQt5
- requests
- beautifulsoup4
